purpose:
  goals:
  - Provide context-aware AI assistance from terminal
  - Support multiple AI providers (Claude, GPT-4, local)
  - Enable command suggestions and explanations
  - Generate code from natural language prompts
  key_features:
  - Multi-provider AI support with provider abstraction
  - Shell context capture (directory, environment, history)
  - Conversation memory for related queries
  - Syntax-highlighted rich output formatting
  - Interactive setup wizard for configuration
  architecture_patterns:
  - Provider pattern for AI integration
  - Configuration-driven multi-backend support
  - Context collector pattern for environment awareness
  - Command pattern via Cobra framework
development:
  setup: make setup-dev
  build: make build
  test: make test
  dev_run: ./bin/how "test prompt"
  install_local: make install
  key_commands:
    setup: how setup
    query: how "your question here"
    explain: how explain kubernetes
    generate: how write a bash script to backup MySQL
verification:
  test: make test
  build: make build
  lint: golangci-lint run ./...
conventions:
  naming:
    packages: lowercase, single-word where possible
    functions: camelCase, exported functions capitalized
    files: snake_case.go for internal, descriptive names
  code_patterns:
    config: Use Viper for all configuration management
    cli: Use Cobra for command definitions
    errors: Return errors explicitly, no panics in production code
    logging: Use structured logging for debugging
    context: Always capture and pass user shell context
structure_notes:
  entry_point: cmd/root.go or cmd/main.go
  config_location: ~/.config/how/ or XDG_CONFIG_HOME
  provider_abstraction: Supports pluggable AI backends
  state_management: Config stored in YAML via Viper
